Repository for loads of solutions to kattis problems that I came up with. 

All of these solutions have passed the specific problem they were targetting, however, I cannot guarantee that they will work for you. 
I also suggest that you do not just copy these solutions and put them into kattis for free points, as that is in bad faith (as it disrupts the difficulty ranking for the problems)
